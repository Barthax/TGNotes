[QUOTE=jmb;862774]Another record! Congrats. Bouncing and through the grass for the fastest lap time. Never would have thought that would work.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE=RaGe;862777]Thanks, guys. Like the "O'Neill Tunnel Bounce" (lol) you have to hit the wall with mostly the side of your car, or you'll crash. As long as you jump off the grass before you start turning, you won't spin from it.[/QUOTE]
