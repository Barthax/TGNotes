              <p>Thank you very much for participating in the contest. 
We are so happy to have over 600 awesome contestants in this contest. 
Again we have two counter-stop scores as shown in the ranking---which 
amazed us. But the champion for Monster Fair is Mr. Bob Saito who got 
-61- Voyages. Congratulations champion,  and all award winners!</p>
              <p>The special Monster Fair T-shirts shown on the left and certificates were presented to the winners.</p>
              <p>Now we are happy to introduce the comments of the award winners as follows. Here we go!</p></td>

                  <td height="48"><p>I started playing real arcade 
pinball games in the late 60's. I was a small kid who needed to stand on
 something to play. Now it's difficult to find pinball machines in 
arcades and real pinball machines have become a part of history. </p>
                    <p>However, we have computer pinball games now and, 
as long as we can play high quality pinball games from Littlewing, 
pinball will remain alive. </p>
                    <p>My reason for playing pinball was, originally, to
 release stress in a short period of time. However, I took several 
months to archive this high score, playing for a few hours every night 
after my family went to bed ;-)</p>
                    <p> Compared with Jinni Zeala, which provides 
unlimited extra balls, Monster Fair limits extra balls to only 9 or 10, 
so it requires very precise flipper control. Also there are fewer 
targets with big bonuses. My biggest breakthrough was finding tactics to
 complete each show without too much risk. </p>
                    <p>There are also some targets I should not try in 
single-ball mode, which require very sensitive nudging to recover. 
Physical condition was also a big factor, so I avoided playing when I 
was tired or frustrated.</p>
                    <p> I thank Mr. Jesus, who accomplished the counter 
stop on his first try and convinced me to achieve it. I also thank Mr. 
Kawamura for sharing tactics and offering playing tips. Finally, I 
really appreciate my PC and UPS for never failing in the middle of play 
and my family who allowed me to play Monster Fair every night without 
complaint.</p></td>
